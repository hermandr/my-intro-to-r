##R is a programming language for statistical computing

"Quirky, flawed, and an enormous success"

<li>Pros

<ul>
<li>"The best thing about R is that it was written by statisticians, …" — Bo Gowgill, Google</li>
<li>Free and open source</li>
<li>Packages/Libraries for anything</li>
<li>Community support + Commercial development</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Cons

<ul>
<li>"…, the worst thing about R is that it was written by statisticians." — Bo Gowgill, Google</li>
<li>Steep learning curve (<a href="http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/" title="">The R Inferno</a>)</li>
<li>Speed (particularly, skill dependent, or when on Windows)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Francois Pinard: "Using R is a bit akin to smoking"

<ul>
<li>"The beginning is difficult, one may get headaches and even gag the first few times."</li>
<li>"But in the long run, it becomes pleasurable and even addictive."</li>
<li>"Yet, deep down, for those willing to be honest, there is something not fully healthy in it."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternatives: Python, Julia</li>
</ul>
